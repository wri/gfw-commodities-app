                        The Global Forest Watch Commodities forest change analysis tool uses spatial and temporal information to allow you to conduct your own investigation on forest cover change, current land cover, and legal classifications in an area of your choice. Users can analyze tree cover loss and fire activity according to ten different spatial datasets: Primary forests; Legal classes; Forest carbon stocks; Global land cover; Southeast Asia land cover; Indonesia land cover; Tree cover density; Protected areas; Intact forests; and Peat lands.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       The forest change analysis tool evaluates the total tree cover loss and number of active fires within the selected variables, and shows the results according to the various classes within that variable. The results allow users to view tree cover loss and fire activity in any selected area, including concession boundaries, a province or district, the radius around a palm oil mill, or a custom shape drawn or uploaded on the site. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        More information on the spatial data used in the forest change analysis tool can be found on the Data Page (link to data page), and all data is free for download. The years used for the analysis vary by data set depending on the availability and relevance of historical data. For some data sets the year 2005 is used as the start to reflect mandates enacted by the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil.

                    <p>Palm oil production in Indonesia has the potential to generate local benefits if oil palm cultivation expansion follows sustainable planning and management practices, including respect for local interests and rights. Potential benefits include increased incomes, profits, and government revenues, reduced poverty, and improved natural resource management. Whether this potential is achieved will depend on how new areas for oil palm cultivation are identified.
                    </p>
                    <p>This demonstrates how to implement a quick and cost-effective method for identifying potentially suitable areas for oil palm cultivation. The method is designed in accordance with established standards for sustainable palm oil production, such as those of the roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO); incorporates relevant Indonesian laws and policies; and is consistent with proposed national REDD+ strategies to support palm oil production on low carbon degraded land. The method consists of a desktop analysis using readily available data and rapid field assessments. It is based on a set of indicators related to selected environmental, economic, social, and legal considerations.
                    </p>
                    <p>This method can be used by companies as a first step in a site selection process for certified sustainable plantation and can inform government officials and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in assessing land use policy options to support the expansion of sustainable palm oil production on degraded land. However, since it is designed primarily to rapidly identify the highest priority areas for further investigation, it should not be used to predetermine where oil palm cultivation expansion should occur.
                    </p>
                    <p>Using this method as a first step in a site selection process can reduce the costs of implementing the additional due diligence activities required to confirm the suitability of a potential site for oil palm cultivation. These activities, which are outside the scope of this paper, include community mapping to document community claims and rights, conducting high conservation value (HCV) and social impact assessments, implementing a comprehensive free prior and informed consent (FPIC) process, and fulfilling legal requirements.
                    </p>
                    <p>The World Resources Institute (WRI) and Sekala applied this method to identify nine potentially suitable areas in the Indonesian province of West Kalimantan for a pilot sustainable palm oil project under Project POTICO (<a href="http://www.wri.org/project/potico" target="_blank">http://www.wri.org/project/potico</a>).These nine sites were identified through targeted field assessments of high priority sites identified through the desktop analysis using project-specific criteria and do not represent all potentially suitable areas in the province.
                    </p>
                    <p>The desktop analysis, the first step in this method, classified a total of approximately 7 million hectares of land in the provinces of West Kalimantan and Central Kalimantan as potentially suitable, using the best publicly available data at the time of publication. This desktop analysis, associated data, and other supplemental materials are being made easily accessible on a public website (<a href="http://wri.org/publication/identifying-degraded-land=sustainable-palm-oil-indoneisa" target="_blank">http://wri.org/publication/identifying-degraded-land=sustainable-palm-oil-indoneisa</a>). The website will also allow users to generate their own suitability maps – using parameters of their choice – to guide their own targeted field assessments.

                    <h3>Context:</h3>
                    <p>The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) Principles &amp; Criteria (P&amp;C) (Criteria 7.3) stipulates:</p>
                    <p class="source_category_description">
                        New planting since November 2005 have not replaced primary forest or any area required to maintain or enhance one or more High Conservation Values (HCV).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        RSPO palm oil producer members are required to have completed HCV assessments on their land holdings for new plantings since November 2005. According to the Specific Guidance for 7.3.1: 
                    </p>
                    <p class="source_category_description">
                        Where land has been cleared since November 2005, and without prior and adequate HCV assessment, it will be excluded from the RSPO certification program until an adequate HCV compensation plan has been developed and accepted by the RSPO.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The RSPO Remediation and Compensation Procedures were developed in order to establish a formal mechanism to identify and, where appropriate, remediate or compensate for potential losses of HCV associated with clearance of areas without prior HCV assessment and to provide a pathway for certification applicants in control of areas non-compliant with 7.3 to resolve their non-compliance in order to proceed with certification (or maintain their certified status. Effective May 9, 2014, the staged implementation of the Remediation and Compensation procedures requires all RSPO members who own and/or manage land for oil palm production to disclose any non-compliant land clearance and to submit a historic land use change analysis for these non-compliant areas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, the revised 2013 P&amp;C (7.3.2) further states that HCV assessments shall include 
                    </p>
                    <p class="source_category_description">
                        Land use change analysis to determine changes to the vegetation since 2005. This analysis shall be used, with proxies, to indicate changes to HCV status.

                    <h3>Approach:</h3>
                    <p>
                        Global Forest Watch Commodities (GFW-Commodities) is an online mapping and analysis tool created by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and over 40 partners. WRI has developed an “RSPO Land Use Change Analysis” tool for GFW-Commodities that produces an estimated result for the historic land use change assessments required by the RSPO Remediation and Compensation Procedures and New Plantings Procedures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This analysis is based on the guidelines described in Section 7 and Annex 2 of the Remediation and Compensation Procedures and summarized below. The output for a user-defined area of interest describes hectares of annual tree cover loss beginning in 2006 within four land cover categories, which are approximations of the vegetation coefficient categories described in Section 7, with a baseline year of 2005. These categories are: “primary forest”, “secondary forest”, “agroforest”, and “non-forest.”

                    <p>
                        The GFW-Commodities RSPO analysis uses ArcGIS Image Server to intersect Annual Tree Cover Loss data (Hansen et al., 2013) with a reclassified version of the Southeast Asia 2005 Land Cover dataset (Gunarso et al., 2013). This analysis identifies pixels where loss occurred in the years of interest and the land cover type upon which that loss occurred. All land cover types were reclassified into “primary forest”, “secondary forest”, “agroforest”, or “non-forest”. See data descriptions and table below for full reclassification scheme.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Data:</h3>

                    <p class="source_category_description">Land cover classifications:</p>
                    <p>
                        The Southeast Asia Land Cover dataset (Gunarso, et al., 2013) identified 22 different land cover types using visual interpretation of Landsat 4, 5, and 7 images over three time periods (1990 to 2000, 2001 to 2005, and 2006 to 2009/2010).  Three types of natural forest were identified:  upland forest, swamp forest, and mangrove.  These forest classes were further characterized by their level of human activity:  undisturbed or disturbed.  Undisturbed forest classes are characterized by an absence of logging roads and settlements.  Disturbed forest classes showed evidence of logging including roads and small-scale clearing.  Undisturbed upland forest, swamp forest, and mangroves were reclassified as “primary forest” for the purposes of this RSPO analysis whereas disturbed upland forest, swamp forest and mangrove were reclassified as “secondary forest.” All other land cover classes including managed tree plantations (timber, rubber, and oil palm) were reclassified as “non-forest” with the exception of “mixed tree crops / agroforest” which fit into RSPO’s “agroforest” land cover class.  The 2005 time step of the land cover data, representing 2001-2005, serves as the baseline land cover for the RSPO Land Use Change Analysis.
                    </p>

                    <p class="source_category_description">Land cover change:</p>
                    <p>
                       A complete land cover change dataset is not available for each of the required years for analysis under the RSPO procedures, so the GFW-C RSPO Land Use Change Analysis tool utilizes a global layer describing annual tree cover loss (Hansen et al., 2013) as a proxy for land cover change. This data set measures areas of tree cover loss at 30 x 30 meter resolution across all global land except Antarctica and some Arctic islands. The data were generated using multispectral satellite imagery from the Landsat 7 thematic mapper plus (ETM+) sensor. Landsat 7 images were compiled and analyzed using Google Earth Engine.  Clear land surface observations in the images were assembled chronologically and pixel tree cover loss was identified using a supervised learning algorithm.  “Tree cover” is defined as all vegetation taller than 5 meters in height and identifies the biophysical presence of trees in the form of natural forests as well as plantations over a range of canopy densities.  “Tree cover loss” indicates the complete removal or mortality of tree canopy cover at the Landsat pixel scale due to a variety of factors including but not limited to mechanical harvesting, fire, disease, or storm damage.

                    <h3>Cautions:</h3>

                    <p>
                        This analysis is intended to be used as a preliminary estimate. It should not be used to fully meet the land use change analysis reporting requirements for the RSPO Remediation and Compensation Procedures. The results of this analysis have not been systematically verified. WRI highly recommends the use of multiple sources of satellite imagery and other contextualizing, site-specific information.
